//! On-disk `MTLBinaryArchive` persistence — the Metal-specific SHELL around
//! [`infr_core::kernel_cache::KernelCache`], the same seam `infr-vulkan/src/pcache.rs` rides on.
//!
//! # What this caches, and what it does NOT
//!
//! Turning MSL into something a GPU runs is TWO compilers:
//!
//! 1. the **front end**, MSL → AIR (Apple's IR), which `MTLDevice.newLibraryWithSource:` runs over
//!    the ~340 KiB [`msl_source`](crate::msl_source) assembles, and
//! 2. the **back end**, AIR → that GPU's ISA, which every `MTLComputePipelineState` creation runs
//!    for one kernel.
//!
//! **Only the back end is cached here.** `MTLLibrary` exposes no way to serialize the AIR it just
//! produced — `newLibraryWithSource:` is the only public entry point that accepts MSL, and nothing
//! on the resulting library hands the compiled module back out. The only supported way to persist
//! a `.metallib` is to compile it AHEAD of time with `xcrun metal`, which needs the Xcode command
//! line tools installed on the user's machine; that is not an acceptable runtime dependency for a
//! CLI, so the front-end compile is paid on every launch and shows up as `library` in the
//! `INFR_PROF` line. If that turns out to dominate, the answer is a build-time `.metallib` in the
//! release artifact, not a runtime cache — a separate slice.
//!
//! What IS cached is every PSO: `MTLBinaryArchive` collects compiled compute pipelines, serializes
//! to a file, and — passed as `MTLComputePipelineDescriptor.binaryArchives` — lets a later launch
//! create those pipelines from the stored ISA instead of re-running the back end.
//!
//! # Shape: the archive GROWS during a run
//!
//! Metal's archive behaves like Vulkan's `vkPipelineCache`, not like a code object: PSOs are
//! created LAZILY (`Pipelines::get` on first use of each kernel), so the artifact is not finished
//! at init. The lifecycle therefore mirrors `infr-vulkan/src/pcache.rs` exactly — seed at
//! [`Pipelines::build`](crate::shaders::Pipelines::build), add each pipeline as it is created, save
//! DEBOUNCED during the run (so a `serve` killed with SIGKILL still leaves a useful blob), save
//! once more on drop, and [`disarm`](KernelCache::disarm) the tripwire on a clean exit.
//!
//! # Bytes through the seam, not a bare file
//!
//! `MTLBinaryArchive` only speaks URLs: it loads from one and serializes to one. The seam is
//! byte-oriented — and the seam is where the envelope, the payload checksum, the atomic+durable
//! write and the poisoned-blob TRIPWIRE live, none of which we want a second, weaker copy of. So
//! the archive is bounced through a temp file at each boundary (serialize → read the bytes →
//! [`KernelCache::store`]; [`KernelCache::load`] → write the bytes → hand Metal that URL) and the
//! temp is removed. The seeding temp outlives the load call deliberately — see [`ArchiveCache`].
//!
//! The payload is not the raw archive: it carries a manifest of the function names inside it, so a
//! launch can tell "already compiled" from "must add" without re-adding (and thus re-compiling)
//! every kernel. That framing, and the cache key, are in [`pcache_blob`](crate::pcache_blob),
//! which is device-free so it can be tested off a Mac.
//!
//! # Every failure is a fallback, never an error
//!
//! A device without binary-archive support, an OS that refuses the archive we saved, a serialize
//! that fails, a blob that fails its checksum, a manifest that will not parse, a pipeline the
//! archive path cannot produce: each one drops back to plain
//! `newComputePipelineStateWithFunction:` and the run continues at cold speed.
//! `MTLPipelineOption::FailOnBinaryArchiveMiss` is deliberately NEVER used — a miss must
//! RECOMPILE, not fail.
//!
//! `kernels.metal.pipeline_cache = false` turns the whole thing off (no directory, no file, no
//! archive object).
