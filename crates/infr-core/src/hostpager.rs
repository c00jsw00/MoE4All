//! The DRAM tier of the weight pager: a fixed-size host arena of uniform slots, filled from a
//! [`BlockIo`] on a miss and read IN PLACE while pinned (`docs/disk-streaming-plan.md` §3.3).
//!
//! Unlike the VRAM pagers, whose callers copy a slot's bytes out and then forget it, this tier's
//! callers dereference the slot itself — a CPU kernel reads a weight for a whole op, a staging copy
//! reads one until the copy is recorded. That is what the pins in [`crate::pager`] are for, and it
//! is why the arena is raw storage rather than a `Vec` behind a lock: readers of different slots
//! must not serialize against each other or against a fill.
//!
//! # Soundness
//! One `Mutex` guards ALL residency state (the [`Pager`], the per-block [`SlotState`]); the arena
//! bytes are outside it, reached only through raw pointers under these rules:
//!
//! - **A slot is written only by the thread that put its block into [`SlotState::Loading`]**, which
//!   happens under the lock, on a miss, for a block that thread has just pinned. A pinned block
//!   cannot be evicted, so no other thread can be handed the same slot meanwhile.
//! - **A slot is read only through a [`Pin`]**, which exists only for a block that is `Ready` and
//!   pinned. Any thread asking for a `Loading` block waits instead of reading it.
//! - **The arena is never reallocated**, and no reference to the whole buffer is ever formed —
//!   every access is a `from_raw_parts` over one slot's own range, so a reader of slot 3 and a
//!   filler of slot 7 never hold overlapping references.
//!
//! Together those give: for any byte, at most one writer and no concurrent reader.
