//! How much host memory a weight arena may take, and how much there is to take
//! (`docs/disk-streaming-plan.md` §7 question 3).
//!
//! The DRAM tier's arena is ANONYMOUS, non-evictable memory — the expensive kind backlog B30
//! measured — so its size cannot be a guess. Two separate concerns live here:
//!
//! - [`available_bytes`], a PLATFORM probe of what could be committed right now. It is deliberately
//!   allowed to answer "I do not know" rather than estimate, because an over-estimate here is an
//!   out-of-memory kill or a swap storm mid-generation, not a slow run.
//! - [`auto_cache_bytes`], the PURE arithmetic that turns that answer into a budget. Separate so
//!   the policy can be tested without a machine that happens to have the right amount of RAM free.
//! - [`process_resident_bytes`], the current process working set used to resolve an explicit
//!   total-process RAM budget into the part that can actually become a weight cache.

/// Host memory that could be committed right now, or `None` where this platform has no probe.
///
/// `None` is a real answer and callers must treat it as one: it means "do not auto-size", not
/// "assume zero" and not "assume plenty". The tier then stays off unless the user names a budget,
/// which is the conservative failure — a model that would have streamed simply does not, and says
/// so, instead of the process being killed part-way through a generation.
///
/// **Linux** reads `MemAvailable` from `/proc/meminfo`, which is the kernel's own estimate of what
/// a new allocation can have without swapping — it already accounts for reclaimable page cache, so
/// it is exactly the figure this tier wants and not something derivable from `MemTotal`.
///
/// **Windows** reads `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` and uses the smaller of `ullAvailPhys` and
/// `ullAvailPageFile`. The arena needs both reusable physical pages and commit charge;
/// `VirtualAlloc(MEM_COMMIT)` can fail even with free RAM when the process/system commit limit is
/// tighter. Every other platform answers `None` today; macOS would need `host_statistics64`'s
/// free/inactive/purgeable split.
///
/// **A cgroup memory limit overrides it.** `/proc/meminfo` is host-wide and knows nothing about the
/// limit a container or a `systemd-run --scope -p MemoryMax=` puts on this process — measured on
/// this box, an 8 GiB scope still reports 54.6 GiB available. Sizing an anonymous arena from that
/// figure is an OOM kill, so the smaller of the two wins.
