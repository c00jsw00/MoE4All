//! Shared KV-cache / VRAM-budget arithmetic.
//!
//! Deciding *where* a KV cache or a weight bank lives is two separable things: the device half
//! (`vkCreateBuffer`, the memory type, the arena, the staging ring) and a
//! device-INDEPENDENT half — how many bytes a KV format costs, which `INFR_*` knob spells what,
//! the cumulative-cap gate the VRAM-first spill applies, and the one-shot placement banner. The
//! second half was re-derived per backend (and, inside `infr-vulkan`, per multi-device wrapper)
//! and drifted. This module hosts it ONCE.
//!
//! What is here:
//!
//! - [`parse_kv_dtype`] — the `INFR_KV_TYPE_K` / `INFR_KV_TYPE_V` name grammar (llama's
//!   `--cache-type-k` / `--cache-type-v`), the single spelling table.
//! - [`kv_fmt_bytes`] — the EXACT allocation size of a KV buffer of `elems` elements, and
//!   [`kv_bytes_per_elem`] — the same thing as a fractional per-element rate, which is what the
//!   context-fit ESTIMATES divide by. The two must agree; a test pins them against each other.
//! - [`flag_from`] / [`mib_bytes`] / [`reserve_bytes`] — the grammars and accessors the spill
//!   knobs share (`empty`/`0` = off; a MiB count → bytes; the 12%-of-VRAM-floored-at-2-GiB
//!   reserve). The VALUES come from the backend's [`Config`](crate::config::Config); nothing here
//!   reads the environment (R3).
//! - [`SpillTally`] / [`SpillCounts`] / [`spill_report_line`] — the VRAM-first placement
//!   bookkeeping and its banner. The counters and the message SKELETON are shared; every noun and
//!   every device-specific clause is passed in ([`SpillNouns`]), and so is the byte formatter,
//!   because a backend's MiB rounding is user-visible text that must not move.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT here (device facts that only look shared):
//!
//! - The placement itself. Whether VRAM has room is a device question (Vulkan's live
//!   `VK_EXT_memory_budget` heap probe minus a guard headroom, in `vram_budget_fits`). Only the
//!   cumulative *cap* gate ([`SpillTally::admits`]), which is pure arithmetic over the tally, is
//!   shared.
//! - The human-readable byte formatter. Vulkan prints MiB to one decimal; unifying the spellings
//!   would move user-visible text for no behavioral gain, so [`spill_report_line`] takes the
//!   formatter as a parameter instead.
//! - The per-format GATES (`kv_align_ok`, which backends have a Q8 KV kernel, TurboQuant's
//!   `head_dim % 128`). Those are capabilities, and they stay at the seam that knows the backend.
