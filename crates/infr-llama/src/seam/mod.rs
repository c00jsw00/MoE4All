//!
//! Split into submodules (pure move, zero behavior change): [`weights`] holds the per-layer
//! weight-handle structs and the persistent seam session state; [`sc`] holds the DiffusionGemma
//! self-conditioning pieces; [`runner`] holds the giant backend-generic `generate_dense_backend`

//! family, and the small shared helpers every submodule reaches into.

/// **Both call sites are already past the point where the model did not fit VRAM** — dense

/// reaching here IS the signal that this run has to stream. An explicit `device.ram_budget` still
/// wins; otherwise the budget is sized from what the host can actually spare
/// ([`infr_core::hostmem`]), because a tier that is off by default helps nobody on the one run
/// that needs it, and the alternative is a user guessing a number that is worth 1.6x
/// (`docs/perf/results.md`).
///
/// # Forcing this path on hardware that would not take it
/// Auto-sizing never REPLACES the two knobs, because a machine big enough to hold the model
/// resident is exactly the machine you want to test streaming on. `INFR_CACHE` (`paging.cache`)
/// caps the VRAM paging budget, which is what forces residency to be rejected and this function to
/// be reached at all; `INFR_RAM_BUDGET` (`device.ram_budget`) then pins total process RAM instead
/// of letting it be measured. Both together can force this path on a machine that would otherwise
/// keep the model resident. Legacy `paging.dram` pins only the raw host-cache size.
///
/// # Unified memory has only ONE host tier, and it is the arena above this one
/// `unified` is `DeviceCaps::unified_memory` — an iGPU or APU whose "VRAM" IS system RAM. There the
/// arena above already sits in host memory, so a host tier beneath it would hold extra blocks in
/// the same RAM that the GPU CANNOT read directly: every hit would still be copied through the
/// staging ring, while the identical bytes spent on the arena above are read in place. It is not
/// merely double-counted, it is strictly worse than making that arena bigger. So auto-sizing
/// declines on unified memory and says why; an explicit `device.ram_budget` is still honoured,

/// V4's raw attention is `build_attn_mha(q, k_all, k_all, …)` — K and V really are the same rows —
/// so `(head_dim, 0)` with `Op::Attention` pointed at one buffer for both sides is the shape the
/// arithmetic wants. It is not the shape this codebase can execute: the CPU backend's
/// `Op::Attention` arm takes `cpu_buf(kbuf).read()` and `cpu_buf(vbuf).read()` as two
/// SIMULTANEOUSLY-LIVE guards (`crates/infr-cpu/src/lib.rs`), and a KV buffer is
