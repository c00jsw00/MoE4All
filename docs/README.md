# infr docs

Design docs, backend architecture, performance playbooks, and campaign logs for
the `infr` inference engine. The top-level project overview lives in the root
[`README.md`](../README.md); everything here is deeper reference.

## Using infr

- [thinking-controls.md](thinking-controls.md) — native reasoning effort, per-request
  thinking controls, model differences, and reasoning-history replay.
- [../GETTING_STARTED.md](../GETTING_STARTED.md) — clean-clone installation,
  native Windows 11 prerequisites, release build, Vulkan verification,
  small-model smoke test, launch wizard, GUI, server, and troubleshooting.
- [config.md](config.md) — the configuration reference: the four layers
  (defaults < config file < `INFR_*` env < CLI flags) and their precedence, the
  TOML file format and lookup order, `--set`, and a per-section walkthrough of
  what is tunable. Start here before reaching for an `INFR_*` variable.

- [context-resource-matrix.md](context-resource-matrix.md) - the Windows long-context resource
  matrix: synthetic 16/32 and 24/64 GiB machines, automatic/manual budgets, exact dynamic-KV
  boundary crossings, API prefix reuse, and live RAM/VRAM enforcement.
- [release-validation.md](release-validation.md) - the pre-release runbook: fixed commands,
  low-frequency waiting, failure triage, allowed small fixes, escalation boundaries, reruns, and
  the final release gate.

## Performance

Everything performance-related lives under **[perf/](perf/README.md)** — start
at that index. It holds:

- [perf/results.md](perf/results.md) — the numbers: every validated model ×
  quant against llama.cpp on an RX 7900 XTX, per-row footnotes for each kernel
  slice that moved a column, and where infr still loses. Moved out of the root
  README, which now carries only the headline.
- [perf/benchmarking.md](perf/benchmarking.md) — how to produce them:
  `infr bench` / `infr compare --sweep` against `llama-bench`, per-op GPU
  profiling, shape-itemised buckets, CPU `samply`.
- [perf/playbook.md](perf/playbook.md) — the optimization method and the
  recorded dead ends. Read before starting a perf slice.
- [perf/kernels.md](perf/kernels.md) — cross-backend fast-kernel coverage (24/24
  quant formats on CPU / Vulkan / Metal) and each backend's decode strategy.
- [perf/cpu.md](perf/cpu.md) — the CPU backend's own roadmap.
- [perf/vulkan-review.md](perf/vulkan-review.md) — multi-vendor review: what is
  RDNA3-tuned versus portable, and the per-vendor gaps.

## Backends

- [unified-memory-architecture.md](unified-memory-architecture.md) - 分层统一内存与专家缓存的
  目标架构：专家簇、尺寸类 LRU、VRAM/RAM/SSD tier、owner 生命周期与物理传输后端；
  [Mermaid 图](unified-memory-architecture.mmd)单独保存，便于后续实现同步更新。
- [metal.md](metal.md) — Apple GPU backend (`infr-metal`) architecture: the
  `DEC16` decode kernels, decode-parity campaign, multi-slot serve, native-read
  KV, MTP, and the replay-tape correctness fix.
- [igpu.md](igpu.md) — integrated-GPU correctness campaign (AMD APU / Intel iGPU
  / Strix Halo class): the UMA heap-table insight, the per-submit watchdog
  root-cause + submit-splitter fix, and the model survey. Phase 1 complete.

## Models & architectures

- [qwen35.md](qwen35.md) — Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 (`qwen35`): the gated-DeltaNet
  linear-attention + full-attention hybrid, and the interleaved q+gate trap.
- [diffusion-gemma.md](diffusion-gemma.md) — DiffusionGemma design for the
  unified seam: block text-diffusion, the canvas denoise graph, and
  self-conditioning.
- [mtp.md](mtp.md) — multi-token prediction (MTP) speculative decoding for
  qwen35's single NextN head (issue #33).
- [deepseek.md](deepseek.md) — the DeepSeek family port plan (V1 → V2/V3 → V3.2
  → V4), staged around the fact that only the first two stages have a model
  small enough to develop against. Nothing implemented yet.

## Roadmaps & history

- [plan.md](plan.md) — the whole-system shape in one place: what shipped against
  the original MVP, the crate layout and backend seam, the step-by-step recipe
  for **adding a model architecture**, the ranked candidate families, and the
  original milestones as history.
- [train.md](train.md) — LLM training support plan (not yet built).

## Audit

- [audit.md](audit.md) — module-by-module codebase audit for bugs, correctness,
  perf, DRY, and YAGNI.
- [backlog.md](backlog.md) — triaged work that is deliberately not done, with
  why (blocked on hardware, scoped out, or declined), plus withdrawn findings
  recorded so they are not rediscovered. The whole-tree correctness reviews that
  used to live in `code-review.md` were folded into it on 2026-08-03 and that
  file deleted: the re-verified findings are B19–B26, and the reviews' cleared /
  hardening / coverage lists are B27–B29.
